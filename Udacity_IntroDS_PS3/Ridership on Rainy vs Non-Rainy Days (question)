The Mann Whitney test does not compare means...it compares mean ranks. While the mean between rainy and non rainy days is relatively similar, the Mann Whitney U value was very high and the p value was very low. The p value means that "If the groups are sampled from populations with identical distributions, what is the chance that random sampling would result in the mean ranks being as far apart (or more so) as observed in this experiment?" In this case the chance is .01.
